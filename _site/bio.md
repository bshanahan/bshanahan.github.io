*Brendan Shanahan

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institut f√ºr Plasmphysik in Greifswald, Germany as a member of the Stellarator Theory group.  My research focuses on developing numerical methods for plasma fluid turbulence simulation in non-axisymmetric geometries using the BOUT++ framework.
