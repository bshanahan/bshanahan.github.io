    summary: |
      I am a physicist at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik in Greifswald, Germany as part of the Stellarator Theory group.  My research focuses on plasma turbulence, and I spend most of my time developing numerical methods for plasma fluid turbulence simulations in non-axisymmetric geometries using the BOUT++ framework.
